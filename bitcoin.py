    In this project, you'll create a program that that tells
    you when the value of your Bitcoin falls below $30,000.

    You will need to:
    - Create a function to convert Bitcoin to USD
    - If your Bitcoin falls below $30,000 print a message.

    You can assume that 1 Bitcoin is worth $40,000
